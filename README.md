## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Token

Create a `.env` file with your GitHub Personal Access Token:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

To create a token:
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope (for private repos) or `public_repo` (for public repos only)

### 3. (Optional) Configure AI PR Detection

Edit `.env` to customize AI detection rules:

```bash
# Enable/disable AI detection (default: true)
AI_DETECTION_ENABLED=true

# Branch prefixes that indicate AI PRs (comma-separated)
AI_BRANCH_PREFIXES=claude/,ai/,gpt/,copilot/

# Author patterns that indicate AI PRs (comma-separated)
AI_AUTHOR_PATTERNS=devin-ai-integration,github-copilot,claude-bot
```

**For projects without AI PRs**, set `AI_DETECTION_ENABLED=false` to disable AI analysis.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage Guide

### Single Month Analysis

1. Select "Single Month" mode
2. Enter repository URL(s) - one per line for multiple repos
3. Select Month and Year
4. Click "Analyze"

### Compare Two Months

1. Select "Compare Months" mode
2. Enter repository URL(s)
3. Select Month 1 and Month 2 (can be different months or years)
4. Click "Analyze"

### Understanding the Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total PRs** | Total number of PRs created in the selected period |
| **Merged** | PRs that were successfully merged |
| **Open** | PRs still open at the end of the period |
| **Closed** | PRs closed without merging |
| **AI PRs** | PRs identified as AI-generated |
| **AI %** | Percentage of PRs that are AI-generated |
| **Merge Rate** | Percentage of PRs that were merged |
| **Avg Merge Time** | Average time from creation to merge (hours) |
| **PR Velocity** | Average PRs created per day |

### AI PR Detection

AI PRs are identified by configurable rules in `.env`:

| Config | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `AI_BRANCH_PREFIXES` | Branch name starts with any of these prefixes | `claude/`, `ai/`, `gpt/` |
| `AI_AUTHOR_PATTERNS` | PR author contains any of these substrings | `devin-ai-integration`, `copilot` |

**Default rules:**
- Branch prefix: `claude/`
- Author pattern: `devin-ai-integration`

**To disable AI detection completely**, set `AI_DETECTION_ENABLED=false` in `.env`.

### Exporting Data

Each tab (All PRs, AI PRs, Human PRs) has a download button to export data as CSV for:
- Further analysis in Excel/Google Sheets
- Reporting
- Archival
